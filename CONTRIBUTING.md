# Contributing to Uninstallomator

__If you are contributing new labels or improvements, please make your changes in the files within the `fragments` sub-folder. DO NOT edit the full `Uninstallomator.sh` script directly. The main script is generated from the fragments and will be overwritten during assembly. For more details, see the [README.md](utils/README.md) in the `utils` directory.__

We strive to keep the script concise and maintainable. Please avoid adding credit lines to individual labels; we recognize all contributors in the main documentation.

- `main`: The default branch for current development, including new and updated app labels and bug fixes.
